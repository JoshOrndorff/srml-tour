Substrate's SRML -- A Guided Tour
======================

Substrate makes it easy to build an application-specific blockchain by composing runtime modules (and a lot of other cool things too). Substrate comes with a standard library of such modules known as the "Substrate Runtime Module Library" (SRML).

This document gets new developers familiar with the SRML quickly by explaining the features of each module, demonstrating scenarios of how to use the module, and exploring the code. When there are multiple ways to do something, this guide will choose one or two of the better-trodden paths to explore, and point out jumping off places for other techniques.

Maintenance
-----------
Substrate is still under active development, so things change quickly. This documentation is maintained on a best-effort basis. Contributors and sponsors are welcome.

Learning Community
------------------
TODO would love to host weekly peer learning groups to work through and discuss this guide.
